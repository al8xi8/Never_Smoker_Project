## ðŸ“Š Trends and Disparities in Lung Cancer Incidence among Never Smokers in the United States: An Epidemiological Analysis

**Spring 2025**

This project investigates longitudinal trends and disparities in lung cancer incidence among never smokers in the U.S. using data from IPUMS NHIS (1997â€“2023). The goal is to better understand how sociodemographic variables such as race/ethnicity, nativity, education attainment, and income influence cancer outcomes over time.

### ðŸ§ª Part 1: Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR & AAIR)

- Performed data cleaning and variable recoding from NHIS datasets (e.g., smoking status, race/ethnicity).
- Calculated **age-specific incidence rates** using survey sample weights for never smokers and smokers.
- Applied the **US 2000 Standard Population** to compute **age-adjusted incidence rates** (AAIR) for fair comparisons over time.
- Stratified results by smoking status (never vs. ever) and sex (male vs. female).
- Visualized longitudinal trends in AAIR from 1997 to 2023 to examine incidence patterns.

### ðŸ§¬ Part 2: Covariate Analysis (In Progress)

- Will examine how sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, nativity, education, income) relate to lung cancer incidence among never smokers.
- Plan to apply multivariable regression models to assess associations while adjusting for confounders.
- Investigate disparities in incidence rates by subgroup and over time.
